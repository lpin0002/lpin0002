# Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Liam Pinchbeck


## A Quick Summary
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a Bayesian Inference Framework to fit for dark matter related variables using data from the [CTA](https://www.cta-observatory.org)
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™ve previously worked on creating quantized neural networks for data filtering for COMET phase I (through Monash University)

## A longer summary

My name is Liam Pinchbeck and I'm currently doing my PhD at [Monash University](https://www.monash.edu/) with research focusing on observational dark matter detection. The main languages I work in are python and MATLAB, and I have a little experience working with C++, Fortran, mathematica, html, and css.

My current projects are focusing on the data coming out of the [CTA](https://www.cta-observatory.org) and the current frameworks that have been set up around it including ctools, cscripts, gammalib and curently gammapy. If you have some experience with the CTA or gammapy or gammalib in particular, feel free to reach out. I'm always looking to improve my knowledge of these topics.
